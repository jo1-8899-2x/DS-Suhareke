    <h2 class="text-style" of rain tapping against a window has a soothing quality, almost like nature's lullaby. It's easy to get lost in the rhythm, 
        watching the droplets race each other down the glass, their paths constantly shifting with each gust of wind. The smell of fresh rain on the earth, 
        combined with the cool air,
         creates a feeling of calm and renewal, reminding us of the simple beauty in the world that often goes unnoticed.</h2>
